# leaseweb Provider

The leaseweb provider is used to interact with the many
resources supported by Leaseweb. The provider needs to be configured with the
proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    leaseweb = {
      version = "~> 1.2.0"
      source  = "leaseweb/leaseweb"
    }
  }
}

provider "leaseweb" {
  token = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `host` (String) Host for Leaseweb API, defaults to "api.leaseweb.com". May also be provided via LEASEWEB_HOST environment variable if present.
- `scheme` (String) Scheme for Leaseweb API, defaults to "https". May also be provided via LEASEWEB_SCHEME environment variable if present.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) The API token to use. By default it takes the value from the LEASEWEB_TOKEN environment variable if present.

## Multiple accounts

The token necessary for the configuration of the provider is linked to a
particular account. In case you want to manage within a single configuration
resources from different accounts, you'll need to use aliases and the
[provider meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider)
in your resources.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    leaseweb = {
      version = "~> 1.2.0"
      source  = "leaseweb/leaseweb"
    }
  }
}

provider "leaseweb" {
  alias = "nl"
  token = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

provider "leaseweb" {
  alias = "us"
  token = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

resource "leaseweb_dedicated_server" "web-nl" {
  provider  = leaseweb.nl
  reference = "web-nl"
}

resource "leaseweb_dedicated_server" "web-us" {
  provider  = leaseweb.us
  reference = "web-us"
}
```

The token are hardcoded in this example for simplicity, you should use
[input variables](https://www.terraform.io/language/values/variables) instead.
